# Model comparison for my thesis 2018 / 2019 ========

Run scheduled_tests.py [schedule.json] [corpus.csv] to output a results.json
file to the results folder.

The schema for schedule.json is
"model name":[configurations] (see specification of these in testing.py)

The schema for corpus.csv is txt,val columns

Classes are located in testing.py

To create csv files from the .json output produced by scheduled_tests.py, run
"fixResults.R" with the json files situated in ./results/.

If multiple schedules are run, and should be combined, put the .csv results
from "fixResults.R" in separate folders, and run "combineResults.R" with the
folders as arguments.
